Currently, the [website](http://mezuro.org/) has a lot of issues related to the UI that can be improved. 
 * Layouts: Focusing on the forms for the creation of accounts, Reading Groups, Projects, Repositories,
   Configurations, etc.
 * Charts: For displaying the Metric Results.
 * Organization of Grades: Specifically targeting the module results, which need to be manually clicked through
 to show their submodules' grades (in the case of Tree Metric Configurations).
